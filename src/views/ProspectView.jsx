## Your output must match this quality bar:
- qualifying_criteria must be verifiable from public data (job postings, LinkedIn, press releases) — not assumptions
- signals must be observable without talking to the company — external evidence only
- hooks must be outcome-specific and speak to a business pressure, not a feature
- apollo search filters must be specific enough to return < 500 companies, not thousands

Return ONLY valid JSON. No preamble, no markdown fences.`;
